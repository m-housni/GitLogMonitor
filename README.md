# GitLogMonitor
I created this tool to help reducing and resolving merge conflicts at early stages by monitoring the git logs at a regular laps of time. Feel free to improve the functionnality, PRs are welcomed!

## Usage 
1. Put GitLogMonitor.exe on the root of the git repo you want to monitor
2. Launch GitLogMonitor.exe and set your last commit date and the keywords or filenames you want to track
3. You get a sound notification whenever a new commit relates to your tracked keywords (list of files given)
4. If you need to update your last pull date or your keywords, please close and relaunch the tool
5. If you would like to improve the tool, you can find the source code here: https://github.com/m-housni/git-log-monitor

## NB
You may need a compiler like CodeBlocks to get the executable.
